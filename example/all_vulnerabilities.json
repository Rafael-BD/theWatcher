In 1969, the company was renamed\nRittal, in honour of its roots in Rittershausen in Dietzhölztal. Within\njust a few years, Rittal enclosures had become established as a global\nstandard, and have remained so to this day.\"\n\nSource: https://www.rittal.com/com-en/Company\n\n\nBusiness recommendation:\n------------------------\nThe vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately on the affected\ndevices.\n\nSEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product\nconducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further\nsecurity issues.\n\n\nVulnerability overview/description:\n-----------------------------------\n1) Improper signature verification of firmware upgrade files (CVE-2024-47943)\nThe firmware upgrade function in the admin web interface checks if the\npatch files are signed before executing the containing run.sh script.\nThe signing process is kind of an HMAC with a long string as key\nwhich is hard-coded in the firmware and is freely available for download.\nThis allows crafting malicious \"signed\" .patch files in order to compromise\nthe device and execute arbitrary code.\n\n\n2) Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface (CVE-2024-47944)\nThe device directly executes .patch files on a USB stick without any authentication.\nThis leads to an unauthenticated code execution in combination with 1).\n\n\n3) Predictable Session ID (CVE-2024-47945)\nThe device is vulnerable to session hijacking due to insufficient entropy\nin its session ID generation algorithm. The session IDs are predictable,\nwith only 32,768 possible values per user, which allows attackers to pre-generate\nvalid session IDs, leading to unauthorized access to user sessions. This is not\nonly due to the use of an (insecure) rand() function call but also because of\nmissing initialization via srand(). As a result only the PIDs are effectively\nused as seed.\n\n\nProof of concept:\n-----------------\n1) Improper signature verification of firmware upgrade files (CVE-2024-47943)\nTo create a firmware or patch file passing the signature verification\nthe following steps are necessary:\n\n- Store SHA512sum of all files of the fake firmware (needs run.sh) in file \"rittal\"\n- Append hardcoded key \"8ab4ce0f72bce9b3837281b7928732c5abfc43103a681214942dec2cc\n  91f236ce8e9263f5778cc6db253ade368b0db4a9ff2adb9cc9f76c5114fe3ffcaf38bba\" to the file\n- Store SHA512sum of the file \"rittal\" in rittal.sig (delete \"rittal\" file if in directory)\n- Create .tar of fake firmware files (e.g. run.sh & rittal.sig)\n- Rename to <name>.patch\n- Apply firmware upgrade (needs admin session in web interface)\n- Profit\n\nThe attached PoC code creates a new valid .patch file which will be executed with\nroot privileges when the firmware upgrade will be applied.\n\n\n2) Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface (CVE-2024-47944)\nThis PoC describes the exploit from 1) without authentication but physical access.\nFor exploitation a signed (see 1)) firmware or .patch file is needed.\nA script checks for new content of plugged-in USB sticks or SD cards.\nIf there is a .patch file available, the signature verification process\nwill be triggered.\n\nThe attached PoC code can also be used to generate signed firmware files.\n\n\n3) Predictable Session ID (CVE-2024-47945)\nThe following function generates the sessionID for the web interface.\nThe code is part of the json.cgi script, which is invoked by the\nLighttpd web server:\n\n  generate_sessionID(int a1, int UserID)\n  {\n    int pid; // r5\n    int seed; // r0\n\n    pid = getpid();\n    seed = rand();\n    srand(pid + seed);\n    return ((rand() + 123) & 0xFFFFF00F) + 16 * UserID;\n  }\n\nIt has been identified that the rand() function used in the sessionID generation\nhas a complexity of 2^31, which is inherently weak. However, the practical\nimplications for online brute-force attacks are limited due to additional factors.\n\nThe Process ID (PID) can range between 0 and 32768, and the UserID can vary from\n0 to 256, which slightly increases the complexity. The primary issue lies\nin the initial call to rand(), which always returns 1804289383 because it is not\ninitialized with srand(). Since json.cgi is invoked for every request, the\nsubsequent initialization does not take effect. This results in the seed being\nessentially ineffective, leaving only the PID to function as the seed.\n\nThe UserID value is dependent on the user, with \"admin\" having a UserID of 0 and\n\"user\" having a UserID of 1.\n\nConsequently, the sessionID has an entropy of only 32768, making it highly\nsusceptible to exploitation within a few minutes.\n\nThe attached PoC code takes a list of sessionIDs and performs an online\nbrute-force attack. A valid session needs to be active.\n\n\nVulnerable / tested versions:\n-----------------------------\nThe following versions have been tested which were the latest version available\nat the time of the test:\n* 6.17.00\n* 6.19.00.1\n\nIt is assumed that all previous versions <V6.21.00.2 are affected.\n\nThe vendor confirmed that the products 3124.300 IoT Interface and 7030.000 CMC\nIII Processing Unit are affected.\n\n\nVendor contact timeline:\n------------------------\n2024-06-21: Contacting vendor through info () rittal de; no response.\n2024-07-01: Contacting vendor through LinkedIn.\n2024-07-02: Received contact for embedded devices.\n2024-07-03: Sent advisory to Rittal contact.\n2024-07-12: Response from vendor that V6.21.00.2 with fixed vulnerabilities will\n            be released on 2024-09-30.\n2024-10-07: Reserving CVE numbers.\n2024-10-08: Informing Rittal about upcoming security conference talk having Rittal\n            as an example regarding SessionID entropy, sending CVE numbers to vendor,\n            asking again about affected products.\n2024-10-11: Vendor confirms affected products, security fixes have already been\n            published.\n2024-10-15: Coordinated release of security advisory.\n\n\nSolution:\n---------\nThe vendor provides a patched version V6.21.00.2 which can be downloaded from\nthe following URL:\nhttps://www.rittal.com/de-de/products/deep/3124300\n\n\nWorkaround:\n-----------\nNone\n\n\nAdvisory URL:\n-------------\nhttps://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSEC Consult Vulnerability Lab\nAn integrated part of SEC Consult, an Eviden business\nEurope | Asia\n\nAbout SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab\nThe SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is an integrated part of SEC Consult, an\nEviden business.
